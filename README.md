## SvelteKit Node Slack Backup Frontend UI

_This is not affiliated with Slack Technologies, Inc. in any way._

## What is this?

This is a SvelteKit frontend that serves as a UI for the exported slack data, that is exported with a deno script.
The Ui looks for the data in the `data` folder inside `src` folder.
This is still a work in progress.
 

## TODO List

* [ ] Make desktop version instead of server version
* [ ] Make version with adapter-static to be able to load inside Tauri
* [ ] Add load data in desktop version
